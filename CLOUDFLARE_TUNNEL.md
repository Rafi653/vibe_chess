## What is Cloudflare Tunnel?

Cloudflare Tunnel creates a secure outbound connection from your local machine to Cloudflare's network, making your local application accessible from the internet without exposing your IP address or opening firewall ports. It's perfect for:

- **Quick demos** to friends and colleagues
- **Testing** your app from different networks
- **Temporary sharing** without deploying to a server

## Prerequisites

Before you start:

- ‚úÖ Vibe Chess app running locally (see [README.md](README.md) for setup)
- ‚úÖ A Cloudflare account (free account works fine)
- ‚úÖ `cloudflared` CLI installed on your machine

## Installation

### Install Cloudflared

Choose your platform:

#### macOS (Homebrew)
```bash
brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared
```

#### Windows (via Chocolatey)
```bash
choco install cloudflared
```

#### Windows (Manual)
Download from [Cloudflare Tunnel Downloads](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation/)

#### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
```bash
wget -q https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
```

#### Linux (Other)
```bash
wget -q https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64
chmod +x cloudflared-linux-amd64
sudo mv cloudflared-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cloudflared
```

### Verify Installation
```bash
cloudflared --version
```

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Authenticate with Cloudflare

Run this command once to link cloudflared with your Cloudflare account:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login
```

This opens your browser for authentication. Follow the prompts to authorize cloudflared.

### Step 2: Start Your Vibe Chess Application

Make sure your application is running locally:

#### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)
```bash
cd /path/to/vibe_chess
docker-compose up
```

The app will be available at:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend: `http://localhost:5000`

#### Using Manual Setup
Start both backend and frontend in separate terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Create Tunnels

You need **two tunnels** - one for the frontend and one for the backend:

#### Terminal 3 - Frontend Tunnel
```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5173
```

You'll see output like:
```
Your quick Tunnel has been created! Visit it at:
https://random-abc123.trycloudflare.com
```

**Copy this URL** - this is your **public frontend URL**.

#### Terminal 4 - Backend Tunnel
```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5000
```

You'll see output like:
```
Your quick Tunnel has been created! Visit it at:
https://different-xyz789.trycloudflare.com
```

**Copy this URL** - this is your **public backend URL**.

### Step 4: Configure Your Application

Now you need to tell the frontend where to find the backend using the public URLs.

## Configuration Guide

### Option A: Using Docker Compose

Edit `docker-compose.yml` and update the frontend environment variables:

```yaml
  frontend:
    # ... other config ...
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-xyz789.trycloudflare.com
      - VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://your-backend-xyz789.trycloudflare.com
```

Replace `your-backend-xyz789.trycloudflare.com` with your actual backend tunnel URL.

**Then restart the frontend container:**
```bash
docker-compose restart frontend
```

### Option B: Using Manual Setup with .env File

1. Create or edit `frontend/.env`:

```env
# Frontend Environment Variables for Cloudflare Tunnel

# Backend API URL (from your backend cloudflared tunnel)
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-xyz789.trycloudflare.com

# Backend WebSocket URL (usually same as API URL)
VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://your-backend-xyz789.trycloudflare.com
```

2. Replace `your-backend-xyz789.trycloudflare.com` with your actual backend tunnel URL

3. Restart the frontend:
```bash
# Stop the frontend (Ctrl+C) and restart it
npm run dev
```

### Option C: Using Environment Variables Directly

```bash
# In your frontend terminal
cd frontend
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-xyz789.trycloudflare.com \
VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://your-backend-xyz789.trycloudflare.com \
npm run dev
```

### Backend CORS Configuration

Your backend also needs to allow requests from the frontend tunnel URL.

Edit `backend/.env` and add your frontend tunnel URL:

```env
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-abc123.trycloudflare.com
```

Then restart the backend:
```bash
# Stop the backend (Ctrl+C) and restart it
npm run dev
```

Or with Docker:
```bash
docker-compose restart backend
```

## Sharing with Friends

### Share the Frontend URL

Give your friends the **frontend tunnel URL** (e.g., `https://your-frontend-abc123.trycloudflare.com`).

They can:
1. Open the URL in any web browser
2. Create an account or log in
3. Play chess with you in real-time!

### Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep all terminals running**: Your app is only accessible while:
- The backend server is running
- The frontend server is running  
- Both cloudflared tunnels are active

üîÑ **URLs change on restart**: Each time you run `cloudflared tunnel --url`, you get a NEW random URL. You'll need to:
1. Update your configuration files with the new URLs
2. Restart the servers
3. Share the new frontend URL with friends

üí° **Pro Tip**: Keep a text file or note with your current tunnel URLs so you can easily share them.

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Only Run When Needed
- **Start tunnels** only when you want to share your app
- **Stop tunnels** (Ctrl+C) when done to close access

### 2. Use Authentication
The app already includes JWT-based authentication:
- Friends must create accounts to play
- All API endpoints are protected
- This prevents unauthorized access

### 3. Monitor Access
- Check your terminal output for connection logs
- Watch for unusual activity or errors
- Stop tunnels immediately if you see suspicious behavior

### 4. Temporary Sharing
- Quick tunnels (`cloudflared tunnel --url`) are designed for temporary use
- URLs expire after the tunnel is stopped
- For permanent hosting, consider proper deployment

### 5. Don't Share Sensitive Data
- Use a secure `JWT_SECRET` in backend/.env
- Don't commit `.env` files to version control
- Never share your Cloudflare credentials

### 6. Network Bandwidth
- Multiple users will consume your local bandwidth
- Monitor your internet connection performance
- Consider player limits based on your connection

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Frontend can't connect to backend

**Symptoms**: Error messages like "Network Error" or "Failed to connect"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify backend tunnel is running
2. Check `VITE_API_URL` and `VITE_SOCKET_URL` in frontend configuration
3. Ensure URLs don't have trailing slashes
4. Check backend CORS_ORIGIN includes frontend tunnel URL

### Problem: WebSocket connection fails

**Symptoms**: Real-time game updates don't work, moves don't sync

**Solutions**:
1. Confirm `VITE_SOCKET_URL` matches your backend tunnel URL
2. Check that backend tunnel is active
3. Some networks block WebSockets - try a different network
4. Verify backend is running on expected port (5000)

### Problem: "Connection Refused" error

**Symptoms**: cloudflared shows "connection refused"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the local service is actually running
2. Check you're using the correct port (5173 for frontend, 5000 for backend)
3. Try accessing localhost:5173 and localhost:5000 in your browser first

### Problem: Tunnel disconnects frequently

**Symptoms**: URLs stop working after a while

**Solutions**:
1. Check your internet connection stability
2. Look for error messages in cloudflared terminal
3. Restart the tunnel: Ctrl+C then run the command again
4. Update cloudflared: `brew upgrade cloudflared` (macOS)

### Problem: New tunnel URL every time

**This is expected behavior** for quick tunnels. If you need persistent URLs:

1. Create a named tunnel (more setup required):
```bash
# Create a named tunnel
cloudflared tunnel create my-vibe-chess

# Configure it with a config file
# See: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/
```

2. Use a custom domain with Cloudflare Tunnel (requires a domain)

### Problem: CORS errors in browser console

**Symptoms**: Browser shows "blocked by CORS policy"

**Solutions**:
1. Add frontend tunnel URL to backend CORS_ORIGIN
2. Restart backend after changing .env
3. Check backend terminal for CORS-related errors
4. Verify CORS_ORIGIN format (no trailing slash)

### Problem: MongoDB connection fails

**Symptoms**: Backend crashes with "MongoDB connection error"

**Solutions**:
1. If using Docker: ensure MongoDB container is running (`docker-compose ps`)
2. If using local MongoDB: start the MongoDB service
3. Check MONGODB_URI in backend/.env
4. Verify MongoDB is accessible on localhost:27017

## Advanced: Named Tunnels (Optional)

For persistent URLs that don't change, you can create named tunnels:

### 1. Create Named Tunnels
```bash
cloudflared tunnel create vibe-chess-frontend
cloudflared tunnel create vibe-chess-backend
```

### 2. Create Configuration File

Create `~/.cloudflared/config.yml`:

```yaml
tunnel: vibe-chess-frontend
credentials-file: /path/to/.cloudflared/UUID.json

ingress:
  - hostname: vibe-chess.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost:5173
  - service: http_status:404
```

### 3. Route DNS
```bash
cloudflared tunnel route dns vibe-chess-frontend vibe-chess.yourdomain.com
```

### 4. Run Named Tunnel
```bash
cloudflared tunnel run vibe-chess-frontend
```

**Note**: Named tunnels require more setup but provide:
- ‚úÖ Persistent URLs
- ‚úÖ Custom domain support  
- ‚úÖ Better for long-term sharing

See [Cloudflare Tunnel Documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/) for detailed instructions.
