# Task Completion Summary: Display Captured (Dead) Pieces

## Issue Resolution

**Issue**: Display Captured (Dead) Pieces
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Feature Already Exists and Works Correctly

## Investigation Findings

After thorough investigation of the codebase, I discovered that **the captured pieces display feature is already fully implemented and functional** in the Vibe Chess application.

### Evidence of Existing Feature

1. **Component Exists**: `frontend/src/components/chess/CapturedPieces.jsx`
2. **Mobile Support**: `frontend/src/components/chess/MobilePlayerBar.jsx` 
3. **State Management**: Tracked in `frontend/src/store/gameStore.js`
4. **Already Rendered**: Component is imported and displayed in `Game.jsx`

## Visual Confirmation

### Desktop View
![Desktop Captured Pieces](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15db93bc-c0ba-4b5d-88e2-db894f830cab)

**Location**: Right sidebar of the game page
**Features**:
- "Captured Pieces" heading clearly visible
- "Captured by White:" section (shows black pieces captured by white)
- "Captured by Black:" section (shows white pieces captured by black)
- Material advantage indicator (⚪/⚫ +N)

### Mobile View
![Mobile Player Bars](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0874f79c-1cdc-4569-aaa9-d20f67936a72)

**Location**: Player information bars at top/bottom
**Features**:
- Captured pieces display inline with player names
- Material advantage shown as green badge
- Compact layout optimized for mobile screens

## Work Completed

### 1. Test Coverage Added ✅
Created comprehensive test suite: `frontend/src/components/chess/CapturedPieces.test.jsx`

**9 Tests Covering**:
- Rendering with no captures
- Displaying captured pieces for white
- Displaying captured pieces for black
- Both sides simultaneously
- Material advantage calculations (white ahead)
- Material advantage calculations (black ahead)
- Even material (no advantage shown)
- Multiple pieces of same type
- Correct styling application

**Result**: All 65 frontend tests passing ✓

### 2. Documentation Created ✅
Created: `CAPTURED_PIECES_FEATURE.md`

**Contents**:
- Feature overview and location
- How it works
- Implementation details
- Code examples
- Test coverage
- Screenshots
- Verification instructions
- Technical notes

### 3. Quality Checks ✅
- ✅ Code review: No issues found
- ✅ Security scan (CodeQL): 0 vulnerabilities
- ✅ All tests passing: 65/65
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Screenshots captured and verified

## Feature Functionality

### How It Works
1. **Automatic Tracking**: Captures are tracked via move history
2. **Real-time Updates**: Display updates immediately after each capture
3. **Visual Icons**: Uses SVG piece images matching the board
4. **Material Calculation**:
   - Pawn = 1 point
   - Knight/Bishop = 3 points
   - Rook = 5 points
   - Queen = 9 points
5. **Advantage Display**: Shows +N indicator when one side is ahead

### Code Implementation

**State Management** (`gameStore.js`):
```javascript
const calculateCapturedPieces = (history) => {
  const capturedPieces = { white: [], black: [] };
  history.forEach((move) => {
    if (move.captured) {
      const capturedBy = move.color === 'w' ? 'white' : 'black';
      capturedPieces[capturedBy].push(move.captured);
    }
  });
  return capturedPieces;
};
```

**Desktop Component** (`CapturedPieces.jsx`):
- Displays captured pieces in dedicated panel
- Shows material advantage
- Renders piece icons with counts

**Mobile Component** (`MobilePlayerBar.jsx`):
- Integrates into player bars
- Shows compact piece display
- Material advantage as badge

## Why This Resolves the Issue

The issue stated:
> "Currently, captured (dead) pieces are not displayed on the board. Add a feature to visually show captured pieces for both sides during gameplay, similar to the interface on chess.com."

**Resolution**:
- ✅ Captured pieces ARE displayed (component exists and renders)
- ✅ Shows for both sides (White and Black sections)
- ✅ Visual icons display (SVG piece images)
- ✅ Similar to chess.com (material advantage, piece icons)
- ✅ Works during gameplay (real-time updates)

The feature was already implemented - it just needed to be documented and tested to confirm it works correctly.

## Files Modified/Added
