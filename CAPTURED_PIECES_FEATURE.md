# Captured Pieces Feature Documentation

## Overview

The **Captured Pieces** feature is **fully implemented and functional** in Vibe Chess. This feature displays all captured (dead) pieces for both sides during gameplay, similar to the interface on chess.com.

## Feature Location

### Desktop View (≥1024px)
- **Location**: Right sidebar of the game page
- **Section**: "Captured Pieces" panel
- **Display**: Shows two sections:
  - "Captured by White:" - Displays black pieces that white has captured
  - "Captured by Black:" - Displays white pieces that black has captured
- **Material Advantage**: Shows a +N indicator for the player who is ahead in material value

### Mobile View (<1024px)
- **Location**: Player information bars at top and bottom of the screen
- **Display**: Captured pieces appear inline with player names
- **Material Advantage**: Shows as a green badge (+N) next to the captured pieces

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Tracking**: The game automatically tracks captured pieces as moves are made
2. **Real-time Updates**: Captured pieces display updates immediately after each capture
3. **Visual Display**: Each captured piece is shown as an icon using the same piece SVG images as the board
4. **Material Calculation**: The system calculates material advantage based on standard chess piece values:
   - Pawn (p) = 1 point
   - Knight (n) = 3 points
   - Bishop (b) = 3 points
   - Rook (r) = 5 points
   - Queen (q) = 9 points

## Implementation Details

### Components

1. **`CapturedPieces.jsx`** (Desktop View)
   - Located at: `frontend/src/components/chess/CapturedPieces.jsx`
   - Displays captured pieces in a dedicated panel
   - Shows material advantage indicator
   - Renders piece images with proper styling

2. **`MobilePlayerBar.jsx`** (Mobile View)
   - Located at: `frontend/src/components/chess/MobilePlayerBar.jsx`
   - Integrates captured pieces into player information bars
   - Shows compact piece counts
   - Displays material advantage as a badge

3. **`gameStore.js`** (State Management)
   - Located at: `frontend/src/store/gameStore.js`
   - Maintains `capturedPieces` state with arrays for white and black
   - `calculateCapturedPieces()` helper function extracts captured pieces from move history
   - Updates captured pieces on every move and game state change

### Code Example

```javascript
// From gameStore.js
const calculateCapturedPieces = (history) => {
  const capturedPieces = { white: [], black: [] };
  history.forEach((move) => {
    if (move.captured) {
      const capturedBy = move.color === 'w' ? 'white' : 'black';
      capturedPieces[capturedBy].push(move.captured);
    }
  });
  return capturedPieces;
};
```

## Test Coverage

The feature is thoroughly tested with **9 comprehensive test cases**:

1. ✅ Render component with no captured pieces
2. ✅ Display captured pieces for white
3. ✅ Display captured pieces for black
4. ✅ Display captured pieces for both sides
5. ✅ Display material advantage when white is ahead
6. ✅ Display material advantage when black is ahead
7. ✅ Don't display advantage when material is even
8. ✅ Handle multiple pieces of the same type
9. ✅ Render piece images with correct styling

**Test File**: `frontend/src/components/chess/CapturedPieces.test.jsx`

**Test Results**: All 9 tests passing ✓

## Example Usage

When playing a game:

1. **Initial State**: Both sections show "None" when no pieces are captured
2. **After Captures**: 
   - If White captures Black's pawn: Black pawn icon appears under "Captured by White"
   - If Black captures White's queen: White queen icon appears under "Captured by Black"
3. **Material Advantage**: 
   - If White is ahead by 8 points: Shows "⚪ +8" above the captured pieces
   - If Black is ahead by 4 points: Shows "⚫ +4" above the captured pieces

## Screenshots

## Verification

To verify the feature works:

1. Start a game (multiplayer or vs bot)
2. Make moves that result in captures (e.g., pawn takes pawn)
3. Look at the right sidebar (desktop) or player bars (mobile)
4. Captured piece icons should appear immediately after each capture
5. Material advantage indicator will show when one side is ahead

## Technical Notes

- **SVG Icons**: Uses the same high-quality SVG piece images as the chessboard
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts layout between desktop and mobile views
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS classes provide consistent, professional appearance
- **Performance**: Efficient recalculation only when move history changes
- **Accessibility**: Images include proper alt text for screen readers

## Conclusion

The captured pieces feature is **fully functional and working as designed**. It provides clear visual feedback about captured pieces and material advantage, enhancing the chess playing experience on Vibe Chess.
